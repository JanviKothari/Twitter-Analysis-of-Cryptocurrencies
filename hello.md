Hi Janvi,

I know this is the douche-iest way to approach someone, by sending a message in pull request in her repo,
But I couldn't find any other possible means to contact with you.

I was wandering around interesting sentiment analysis repos and stumbled across your profile. 
I am currently looking for someone who could help me and my team with our application.

I have a project for you, So contact me if you are intereted and we will discuss the project further.

Hit me a mail at abhishek02011996@gmail.com or whatsapp me 9530004919
